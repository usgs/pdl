	<h1>Product Distribution User Guide</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		The Product Distribution Layer (PDL) is a USGS platform for exchanging
		information about seismic events such as earthquakes and landslides.
		It provides a standard method for bundling textual and multimedia data
		into a package called a <i>product</i>.
	</p>

	<p>Products are created by USGS and non-USGS clients, distributed
		using PDL, and received by various USGS and non-USGS automated systems
		such as Real-time Earthquake Maps, the Comprehensive Catalog of
		seismic events (Comcat), ShakeMaps, the PAGER earthquake alert system
		and the Earthquake Notification Service. PDL is designed to support
		both existing and future needs for seismic information.</p>

	<p>PDL focuses on distribution and triggering, and integrates with
		other systems for processing. After a product is created it is sent to
		a distribution hub. The distribution hub creates a notification that
		includes a URL where the full product can be downloaded. Clients
		connect to the distribution hub and receive notifications about
		available products. Based on configuration, a client may choose to
		download and process a product.</p>

	<p>PDL provides two primary alternatives for processing products: a
		java API for direct integration, and a command line api for
		applications to be executed when products are received.</p>

	<p>The Product Tracker is an external, opt-in system that tracks
		product activity, including product receipts, sends, downloads and
		notifications.</p>
