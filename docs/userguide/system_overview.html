<h3 id="productsandnotifications">Products and Notifications</h3>

<h4>Product</h4>
<p>A Product is a group of files or content concerning seismic events. Examples of 
product types include ShakeMap, Moment Tensor and Origin. A product usually consists 
of a directory of files, but may also include a stream of bytes, 
links to internet resources, and key/value pairs. Products provide a standard method 
for bundling textual and multimedia data, where each product is uniquely identified 
by source, type, code, and update time. These key attributes are described as follows:</p>
<dl class="indented">
	<dt>source</dt>
	<dd>The product creator. Usually a network code, such as &quot;us&quot; for
	the USGS National Earthquake Information Center or &quot;ci&quot; for the
	Southern California Seismic Network at Caltech.</dd>

	<dt>type</dt>
	<dd>The type of product, such as &quot;helicorder&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, or &quot;moment-tensor&quot;. Multiple sources may create the same type
	of product.</dd>

	<dt>code</dt>
	<dd>A unique code, for a given <code>source</code> and <code>type</code>
	combination.</dd>

	<dt>update time</dt>
	<dd>When this version of content was created. Two products with
	the same <code>source</code>, <code>type</code>, and <code>code</code>,
	but different <code>update time</code>s are different versions of the
	same product.</dd>
</dl>

<p>While some products can be associated with a single seismic event, others are not. 
The harmonic tremors detected by a particular helicorder, for example, could easily have 
originated from several seismic events.</p>

<p>Products are created by USGS and non-USGS clients, distributed using PDL, 
and utilized by various USGS and non-USGS automated systems such as Real-time 
Earthquake Maps, the Comprehensive Catalog of seismic events (Comcat), ShakeMaps, 
the PAGER earthquake alert system and the Earthquake Notification Service. PDL is 
designed to support both existing and future needs for seismic information.</p>

<p>PDL focuses on distribution and triggering, and integrates with other systems 
for processing.  After a product is created it is sent to a distribution hub.  
The distribution hub creates a notification that includes a URL where the full
product can be downloaded.  Clients connect to the distribution hub and receive 
notifications about available products.  Based on configuration, a client may 
choose to download and process a product.</p>

<p>How received products are utilized is very system dependent.  PDL provides two 
primary alternatives: a java API for direct integration, and a command line api 
for applications to be executed when products are received.</p>
 

<h5>Versions</h5>
<p>Products with the same source, type, and code, but different update times are
considered different versions of the same product. Later updates to the
same product replace previous versions, where older versions are retained according 
to PDL's configurable archive policies.</p>

<h5>Status</h5>
<p>A brief status code. Typically <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code>.
Any value that is not <code>DELETE</code> is considered an update. A product 
status may have different meanings depending on product type. "DELETE" always 
has the same meaning: that a product has been cancelled. </p>

<h5>Properties</h5>
<p>Properties are optional name/value pairs that describe the
product. They are used to quickly identify characteristics of a product
without needing to parse its content. Examples include the "alertlevel" 
property of the PAGER product, and the "magnitude-type" property of the 
origin product.</p>
<p>Name/value pair definitions of product properties are generated when a client 
system sends a product to a hub. Properties can originate in two forms: as 
parameters in PDL Java command-line execution, or through a java process using 
the PDL API.</p>

<h5>Links</h5>
<p>Links are optional and are a <abbr
	title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</a> with a relation that
describes how the resource is related to the product. Because the link
is a URI, it can be either a URN or URL. One example would be including
a "background" related link for a product. Another example would be
identifying a related product that was used as an input.</p>


<h4>Notification</h4>
<p>A Notification is a small message with Product's source, type,
code, update time, URL for download, and URL expiration date. Notifications 
are broadcast when a product becomes available for download. Typically client 
systems use notifications as a basis for making product download requests from 
hubs.</p>

<p>When a source deletes a product, the delete is technically equivalent to 
sending a product, except the status is now "DELETE" and contents of the sent 
product are optional. This deleted version of the product is distributed the 
same way as any other update.</p>


<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<p>Product Distribution provides a standard solution for data
distribution.</p>

<p>Data producers and consumers are loosely coupled. Producers
broadcast a product, via redundant hubs, and all clients are notified it
is available. Only clients that are interested download the full content
for processing. This simplifies both sending and receiving data because
all producers and consumers only need to communicate with the hubs.
Because producers and consumers initiate connections to the hubs, most
users do not need to reconfigure firewalls.</p>

<p>Producers use a private key to sign products when they are sent.
Hubs verify this signature using a public key before distributing
products to ensure only authorized producers are able to send products.
Clients may optionally verify these signatures as well.</p>

<p>Clients can be configured to trigger processing when new products
arrive, either using command line arguments or a Java API, eliminating
polling latency. In many cases this has reduced processing time from
minutes to seconds.</p>

<h3 id="storage">Product Processing and Storage Formats</h3>
<h4 id="storagemodel">The PDL Storage Model</h4>
<p>The Product Distribution Layer (PDL) is an improvement over an earlier system
called the Earthquake Information Distribution System (EIDS).  EIDS distributes 
XML products, but does not support large files or binary content like images. While 
PDL uses EIDS as an option for distributing notifications, it improves on EIDS' XML 
mechanism by providing for <i>any</i> type of content, including images, large files 
and whole directory structures.</p>

<h4 id="architecture">High Level Architecture</h4>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the creation and distribution of a product:</p>
<ol>
<li>The producer creates the product on her client machine. She then sends 
the product to a PDL hub via a HTTP request, executed via PDL's Java-implemented API.</li>
<li>The PDL hub stores the product and makes it available at a specific URL.</li>
<li>The hub broadcasts a notification of the product update to clients, also sending 
a product status update to the Product Tracker.</li>
<li>Clients receive the product status notification.</li>
<li>Interested clients request a product download via a HTTP request.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="indexer">Indexer</h4>
<p>The PDL Indexer associates related products into events. The indexer
uses authoritative regions to choose preferred products when multiple
sources contribute the same type of product for the same event. It replaces
an earlier indexing system named QDM (Quake Data Merge), which processed 
fixed-length CUBE messages. The Indexer:</p>

<ul class="spaced-list">
	<li><b>Determines product authoritativeness</b>
	<br />Products may define custom authoritativeness rules</li>
	<li><b>Maintains a catalog of products</b>
	<br />Producers do not need to know any of the consumers</li>
	<li><b>Triggers processing when its catalog changes</b></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pdlbenefits">PDL Benefits</h4>
<p>PDL's processing model provides several distinct advantages:</p>
<ul class="spaced-list">
	<li><b>Integrates with existing systems</b>
	<br />Cross-platform command line program or Java API</li>
	<li><b>Is loosely coupled</b>
	<br />Producers do not need to know any of the consumers</li>
	<li><b>Eliminates polling latency</b></li>
	<li><b>Uses digital signatures</b>
	<br />Provides authentication and integrity</li>
	<li><b>Tracks distribution and processing process</b>
</ul>

<h3 id="receivers">Notification Receivers</h3>

<p>A NotificationReceiver receives Notifications for products and
keeps a NotificationIndex of all received notifications. Whenever a
notification is received, it is queued for processing by each
NotificationListener. Each listener has a separate queue, and uses a
separate thread to process queued notifications one at a time. This
prevents a slow listener from blocking a fast listener.</p>

<p>When a listener processes a notification, it may request the
product from the receiver. Any number of listeners may request the same
product, but the receiver will only download once. Once the receiver has
retrieved the product, the listener processes its contents.</p>

<p>Periodically, the receiver will remove expired notifications from
its index, and downloaded products that are no longer needed. By default
a receiver only keeps downloaded products for 15 minutes, just long
enough for listeners to process, to minimize disk usage.</p>




<h3 id="listeners">Notification Listeners</h3>

<h4 id="externalnotificationlistener">ExternalNotificationListener</h4>
<p>ExternalNotificationListeners process products by executing an
external command line process for each received product. The
ExternalNotificationListener does not associate related products
together, for that functionality use the Indexer.</p>

<h5>Indexer Listeners</h5>
<p>Every time the Indexer changes the index, it notifies IndexerListeners about
the change. IndexerListeners are similar to NotificationListeners but listen
to Indexer changes (which are triggered by products) instead of
listening to notifications for products. Because the indexer keeps track
of previously processed products, duplicate and non-preferred
information can be filtered. Additionally, updates that do not change an
event's location or magnitude can also be filtered.</p>

<h3 id="senders">Product Senders</h3>
<p>A SocketProductSender sends a product directly to a ProductHub,
which stores the product and sends a Notification to all connected
NotificationReceivers. Product hubs register a public key for each
sender, and verify product signatures to ensure only known senders may
distribute products.</p>

<p><a href="sending.html">See Sending Products for more information</a></p>


<h3 id="java">Java API</h3>
<p>Custom Notification and Indexer Listeners can be integrated with
PDL using the Java API. Other languages need to use the
ExternalNotificationListener and ExternalIndexerListener.</p>

<p>NotificationListeners must implement the
gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.NotificationListener interface. Most
users can extend the
gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.DefaultNotificationListener class.</p>

<p>IndexerListeners must implement the
gov.usgs.earthquake.indexer.IndexerListener interface. Most users can
extend the gov.usgs.earthquake.indexer.DefaultIndexerListener class.</p>
