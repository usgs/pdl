################################################################################

Each section of this document starts with a header. The header is easily
identifiable by the string of hash characters (#) above and below the section
header text. Each line of the header is also prefixed with a hash character. The
section headers are meant to clearly delineate the sections of this README file.

This README file assumes you are using the heartbeat sending package on a
Unix command prompt. If you are using Windows or another GUI interface, you will
have to figure out how the Unix commands translate to your environment.

At some points this REAME file will suggest you type commands on the command
line. Command prompt I/O instructions are lead and followed with a blank line.
Throughout the instruction itself, commands to be typed are prefixed with a
percent (%) character. You should type the content on the line with the percent
character exactly as it appears in the instructions.

Some commands you type on the command line will produce output. In this case,
the output from a command will be displayed below the example command in this
README file. Each line of output will be prefixed by a tab character at the
start of the output line. For example:

% ls
	config.sh.template  init.sh  README  sendHeartbeat

% date
	Mon Oct  1 19:02:41 UTC 2012

In these examples, you would have typed "ls" or "date", and you should expect
output similar to what is listed directly below the example command.

# II.  Configuring
#
################################################################################

Upon checking this project out from SVN you should have received a configuration
template file. This template file is for demonstration purposes only. The
heartbeat sender itself actually uses a file called "config.sh" that you must
create. You can use the template file to help you create the actual
configuration file. Copy the template file to the actual configuration file.

% cp config.sh.template config.sh

Note that this configuration file is itself a shell script. This means you _can_
use dynamic values for the configuration settings if you want to. Do this only
if you know what you are doing and understand how the environment might change
when the configuration file is read during the cron process.

Now you can edit the configuration file for the current environment. Open the
file using your preferred text editor (vi, pico, emacs, etc...) and update the
configuration variables as appropriate (see below).

HEARTBEAT_VERSION (Do not change this)
  This is version of the heartbeat sender software.

HEARTBEAT_PATH
  This is the fully qualified system path to where the heartbeat sender is
  installed. This should generally be the same directory where this README file
  is located.

HEARTBEAT_USER
  This is the name of the user that will be sending heartbeat products. This can
  be any user on the system, but that user must have:
    1. A reasonable default PATH setting with things like 'awk', 'java', etc...
	 2. Read access to the HEARTBEAT_PATH directory.
	 3. Read access to the HEARTBEAT_CLIENT jar file (see below).
	 4. Write access to the HEARTBEAT_LOG file (see below).

HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULE
  The schedule on which heartbeats will be sent on this system. This is a
  crontab format schedule string. For example:

  ---------- Minute of hour (0 - 59)
  | -------- Hour of day (0 - 23)
  | | ------ Day of month (1 - 31)
  | | | ---- Month (1 - 12)
  | | | | -- Day of week (0 - 6; 0 = Sunday)
  | | | | |
  * * * * *

  An asterisk (*) means to send for every interval of the given unit. For
  example, '* * * * *', means to send a heartbeat every minute of every hour of
  every day of every month. You can also use things like '*/5' for any value.
  This translates roughly into 'every 5th of these units'. For example,
  '*/5 * * * *', means the heartbeat will be sent every 5th minute of every hour
  of every day of every month.

HEARTBEAT_SENDER
  This is the fully-qualified path to the script that will actually send the
  heartbeat product. If you properly set up the HEARTBEAT_PATH (see above), you
  should not need to change this value.

HEARTBEAT_MARKER (Do not change this)
  This is used during the start/stop process when running the heartbeat sender
  (see below). You should not change this value.

HEARTBEAT_LOG
  This is the fully qualified path to a log file. All output from the sender
  will be logged here. The HEARTBEAT_USER must have write access to this file.


HEARTBEAT_CLIENT
  This is the fully qualified path to the ProductClient.jar JAR file on the
  sender machine. This JAR will have it's own configuration separate from what
  you indicate in the configuration file for the heartbeat sender.
  
  For more information about obtaining product sender client see:
       https://usgs.github.io/pdl/userguide/index.html

  For more information about configuring a product sender client see:
       https://usgs.github.io/pdl/userguide/configuration.html

       
HEARTBEAT_CLIENT_CONFIG
  This is the fullly qualified path to the product client configuration file.
  This file will be used with the --configFile property when sending heartbeat
  messages. This allows you to re-use a client JAR file without forcing the
  re-use of the pre-configured client configuration file. If this is left empty
  then the default client configuration file is used instead.


HEARTBEAT_KEY
  The private key file with which the sender will sign heartbeat products it
  sends. If this is left empty then products will not be signed. Only signed
  products are accepted on the production hubs, however unsigned products can be
  sent for development/testing using pdldevel. The production hubs will need to
  be configured to accept your key before you can send signed products.

  For more information about generating and/or registering a public/private
  key-pair see:
       http://ehppdl1.cr.usgs.gov/userguide/sending.html#signatures

HEARTBEAT_SOURCE
  This is the product source to use when sending products. If you are signing
  your products, your key must be registered for this source.

HEARTBEAT_CODE
  This is the product code to use when sending products. By convention this
  should be set to the system name that is sending the product.

HEARTBEAT_TRACKER
  This is the tracker to use when sending products. Be convention, development
  systems should track to the development tracker and production systems should
  track to the production tracker.

  Development Tracker: http://pdldevel.cr.usgs.gov/tracker/
  Production Tracker:  http://ehppdl1.cr.usgs.gov/tracker/

After configuring the variables appropriate for your system you can now start
the sending process.

# III. Running
#
################################################################################

Running the sender is done by using the included 'init.sh' script. With this
script you can:

 - Start the sender
 - Stop the sender
 - Check the sender status
 - Restart the sender
 - Watch the sender logs
 - Test the sender
 - Get quick tips for using init.sh

For most actions you will require 'root' privileges, for this reason it is
advised you always run the 'init.sh' script with 'sudo'. For simpler/cleaner
commands, the sudo is omitted from examples below. All example commands are
executed from the HEARTBEAT_PATH directory (see above).



- Start the sender

% ./init.sh start
	Starting heartbeat sender...done.

If you try to start the sender when it has already been started you will receive
an error message. You must either stop the sender first, or try a restart.



- Stop the sender

% ./init.sh stop
	Stopping heartbeat sender...done.

If you try to stop the sender when it is not currently started you will receive
an error message. You must start the sender first.


- Check the sender status

% ./init.sh status
	Heartbeat sender is running (Y-m-d_H:i:s).
or
	Heartbeat sender is stopped.

When heartbeat sender is running, the parenthetical data indicates when the
heartbeat sender was started.



- Restart the sender

% ./init.sh restart
	Restarting the sender...done.



- Watch the sender logs

% ./init.sh log
	Log information stored in ${HEARTBEAT_LOG}

This will print the last few lines of the log file and will continue to tail the
log file (tail -f) until you cancel the tail using ctrl-c.
	


- Test the sender

% ./init.sh test
	Sending a heartbeat product...done.

This will attempt to send the product but it may fail. You should check the logs
after this completes in order to see if the product was successfully sent.



- Get quick tips for using init.sh

% ./init.sh
	Usage ./init.sh [start|stop|status|restart|log|test]

# IV.  Troubleshooting
#
################################################################################

Below are some common troubleshooting steps to take if/when a problem arises
with the heartbeat sender. If the resolutions below do not fix the problem, you
can contact the EHP Web Team for more assistance.

I am starting the sender and then I check the logs, but I don't see any
products getting sent.

	When you start the heartbeat sender, an actual heartbeat product will not be
	sent until the next HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULE occurs. That is, if your
	HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULE is set to '*/5 * * * *', and it is currently 42 minutes
	past the hour, the next heartbeat product will not be sent for roughly 3
	minutes (at 45 minutes past the hour).

I have started the sender and waited for the next HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULE interval to
occur, but I still do not see anything in the logs.

	You should double-check your configuration file to make sure you do not have
	any typos that might be causing this error.
	
	If you feel confident the configuration file is correct, check the system
	cron logs (/var/log/cron). Once you open this file, search for the
	HEARTBEAT_MARKER text to verify the cron is executing.

	If the cron is executing, check the file permissions on the HEARTBEAT_LOG
	file to make sure the HEARTBEAT_USER has write permissions on this file.

The logs state, "Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR to log file". Where is this log
information?

	This location of the log referenced by this redirect can be found be checking
	your HEARTBEAT_CLIENT configuration file (generally config.ini in the same
	location as the HEARTBEAT_CLIENT file).
